# README file for the 10b (TwoBit)
#
# 10b is a Java Algorithmic Analysis Application. 
# In a nutshell I want you to be able to use 10b to analyse any type of 
# dataset (numeric, textual, binary, etc) using algorithms of your own 
# choice to help inform your research and decision making.
#
# I decided to write 10b because I couldn't find any 'simple', free, 
# open and extensible algorithmic analysis applications and I need one.  
#
# 10b is open source and free to use, I would however be extremely grateful
# if you can provided constructive feedback from your experience of using it
# to me via my GitHub account: hoos

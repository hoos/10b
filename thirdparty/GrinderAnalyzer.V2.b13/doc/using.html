HOW TO RUN THE ANALYZER

It is only possible to run Grinder Analyzer after a test is completed.
Real-time graph generation while a grinder run is in  progress is not
supported.

To run the analyzer tool from Windows, Linux or OS X:

 1. Open a command-line shell and cd into the grinderAnalyzer directory.
 2. Execute the script like this:
        jython ./analyzer.py "&#60;grinder data file(s)&#62;" &#60;grinder out file&#62; [number of agents]

Quotes are only needed if you have multiple data files.  You cannot specify
multiple grinder out files.


More detail on the agruments:

  * The grinder data files are a set of one or more of the log files
    generated by the Agents.  If you are using just a single data file,
    the quotes are not needed.  These files typically have names like
    "data_agent18-0.log".
  * The grinder out file usually has a name like "out_agent18-0.log".
    The out file and the data file(s) MUST be from the same Grinder run.
  * Number of agents is an optional multiplier you can apply to the bandwidth
    and transactions per second graphs.  This is useful if you had many 
    agents running on several different machines and you are only running
    the analyzer on the log files generated by a single agent.  For this
    multiplier to give meaningful results, it is assumed that each agent is
    doing an identical workload.



CONFIGURATION

The default configurations that ship with Grinder Analyzer have been
pre-tweaked to be reasonable for most use.  However, there are 
options to adjust settings for time groupings, graph size, 
graph granularity, etc., in conf/analyzer.properties.



OUTPUT

All graphs and html are created in a directory named 'grinderReport'.  The
.png files may be viewed in the tool of your choice.  The html report
includes a summary table with sortable columns.

To store the analyzer results long-term, you will need to move or rename
the 'grinderReport' directory, since it is reset every time you run the
analyzer.

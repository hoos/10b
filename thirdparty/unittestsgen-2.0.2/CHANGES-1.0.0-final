1. All classes have javadoc comments for main class.
   At the moment javadoc comments for methods and fields
   are not completed yet.

2. Dedication added for release version. Current and first
   final version is dedicated to Cameron Shorter the man
   who introduced me to Open Source Community.

3. Fixed bug with test code generating when there is no 
   default constructor and all tests generated 
   NullPointerException. At the moment test code is put to
   method but it is commented out.

4. Added dummy test method which should be useful for
   classes which doesn't contain any method so no test
   method is generated.

5. If some object opens dialog window during initialization
   or some methods, tests may hang. So I added awt.EventListener
   to dispose all windows opened during tests. This allow to
   process test without any troubles.

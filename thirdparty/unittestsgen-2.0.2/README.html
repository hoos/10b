<h2>What for?</h2>
<p> Lets assume you started developing your application some weeks ago or
some months ago or even some years ago. I am sure that testing your code was one
of major problems. You thought about automating such process. And than you heard
about <em>Unit Testing</em>. So you would like to start use it. However how to
introduce <em>Unit Testing</em> for large number of source files. There is too
much of stupid code to write in all places again.</p>
<p> Here comes this package. His main goal is save you from wasting time for
creating test classes for your all source files. It takes as an argument sources
directory and than performs some actions which, result with test classes.
<ol>
<li> Searching in given directory for all source files. You can put as a parameter
  file mask which, can improve finding source files.</li>
<li> Parsing sources to structures which, can be processed later.</li>
<li> Generates test files for each given source.</li>
</ol>
<h2> What now? </h2>
At the moment I have ready to use source parser and code generator for Java language
and JUnit package. There are many extensions I can see in this version but at the
moment it is ready to use for simple test generating. <br/>
But it is very modular application and it very easy to use code parsers and generator
for other languages and unit test systems. It is necessary only to create class which,
performs proper actions and returns results. Using different parsers and generators
is very easy only by passing class name as a parameter to command line arguments. <br/>
<em>If you are interested in other languages support please let me know. If you are
interested in creating pasrsers or generators for other languages and unit tests please
let me know or join my project.</em></p>
<h2> How can I use it? </h2>
<p> <b> Although by default it doesn't overwriting existing files remember that it is test
version of application and always make backup of you project before use it. </b> <br/>
<code>unittestsgen.jar</code> ommits all files which, name beggining with <em>'Test'</em>
string or which, are extending <code>TestCase</code> class from <code>JUnit</code> package.
All new classes are stored in files named <b>Test</b>SrcOriginalName.java. <br/>
If you run application with no arguments it display short description of all available
parameters:
<pre>
[user] $ java -jar unittestsgen.jar
</pre>
The most common options are:
<ul>
<li><b>-cf config_file</b> -- file name which contains startup parameters. You can put there all
command line parameters to prevent writing them every time you use this tool. See content
of 'gentest.cfg' sample config file given with package.</li>
<li><b>-i directory</b> -- input directory where are placed your source files, 'src/' is
  default.</li>
<li><b>-o directory</b> -- output directory where test classes shoul be stored, 'test-src/' is
  default.</li>
<li><b>-n pattern</b> -- pattern for test class naming convention. The most common conventions
  are to put 'Test' string at the beginning of test class name or at the end of name,
  default patterns is '*TestCase' what means: append 'TestCase' string to the end
  of base source name class for each created test class.</li>
<li><b>-cp classpath</b> -- because if you run application <code>java -jar jarfile.jar</code>
  and there is no way to pass CLASSPATH in standard way I provided option to add classpath
  through programm interface. Here you should put path to <code>junit.jar</code> your
  classes compiled version or if you have also test classes you should put here jar file
  which contain compiled versions of your test classes. It allow to update code in your
  existing test classes.</li>
<li><b>-f</b> -- force overwriting existing files. Hoever it is not save. You can lost your
  test files you created your own but if you use <em>Unit Test Gen</em> some times
  it is not very comfortable to remove all Test classes before generating them again.
  So you can use this option. And again remember to set proper destination path and
  classpath to allow properly parse your existsing test classes, 'false' is default.</li>
</ul>
Run <code>unittestsgen.jar</code> with no arguments and check defaults values. They are 
designed to be useful for most cases, so the most commonly you should use application 
in the following way:<br/>
On unix like systems:
<pre>
[user] $ java -jar jar/unittestsgen.jar -cp "yourjarfile.jar:libs.jar:junit.jar"
</pre>
In MS windows like systems:
<pre>
D:\projects\yourproject> java -jar unittestsgen.jar -cp "yourjarfile.jar;libs.jar:junit.jar"
</pre>
Where <code>libs.jar</code> contains all necessary libraries used by your application.
Of course if you use many libraries from many jar files you should put all necessary jar
files in <em>'-cp'</em> class path parameter or you will be unable to generate test classes.
</p>
<p>
More info you can find in <a href="doc/testsgen/GenerateTests.html">GenerateTests</a> class
documentation.
</p>
<h2> I have some test classes and what? </h2>
If you have ready to use test classes (classes which, can be compiled with no problems)
you can start unit testing. It can be done in many ways, however preferred are:
<ul>
<li>Run tests for one class only, for example for one choosen class you can run tests 
  with command:<br/>
  On unix like systems:
  <pre>
  [user] $ java -cp "yourjarfile.jar:libs.jar:junit.jar" full.class.Name
  </pre>
  In MS windows like systems:
  <pre>
   D:\projects\yourproject> java -cp "yourjarfile.jar;libs.jar;junit.jar" full.class.Name
  </pre>
  File <em>'yourjarfile.jar'</em> must contain compiled both your project classes and
  of course all generated <em>'Test'</em> classes. And <em>'libs.jar'</em> must contain
  all necessary by your application libraries. Of course you can put there many jar files
  instead of single <em>'libs.jar'</em>.
</li>
<li>Run tests for all classes in one command call. Code generator creates also 
  <code>TestAll.class</code> which, runs all available tests:<br/>
  On unix like systems:
  <pre>
  [user] $ java -cp "yourjarfile.jar:libs.jar:junit.jar" TestAll
  </pre>
  In MS windows like systems:
  <pre>
    java -cp "yourjarfile.jar;libs.jar;junit.jar" TestAll
  </pre>
  File <em>'yourjarfile.jar'</em> must contain compiled both your project classes and
  of course all generated <em>'Test'</em> classes. And <em>'libs.jar'</em> must contain
  all necessary by your application libraries. Of course you can put there many jar files
  instead of single <em>'libs.jar'</em>.
</li>
<li>But the most preferred way is to run all tests from <em>Ant</em> just after
  compilation process finished.<br/>
  To do it. You need:
  <ol>
    <li>Ant package from <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Ant</a></li>
    <li>JUnit package from <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a></li>
    <li>Put some code in your <code>build.xml</code> file to tell Ant how to test 
      your package. Sample code for Ant's <code>build.xml</code> you can find in 
      created file: <code>sample-junit-build.xml</code>. And remember to have
      <code>junit.jar</code> in CLASSPATH <b>before</b> you run Ant.</li>
      To generate reports by ant you must have <code>xalan.jar</code> in your 
      <code>'ANT_HOME/lib/'</code> directory.
  </ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>And again improve your work with ANT</h2>
<p>
Although running <em>'unittestsgen.jar'</em> from command line is very simple and easy
it is not very efficient way for hard developing process. In current version it is
possible to use this tool as <b>ANT</b> task. If you prepare your <em>'build.xml'</em>
file correctly your test classes will be updated permanently every time you start
build process. So you can have your test classes up to date all time during your development
process.
</p><p>
In my projects I use to run unit tests generator every time I build <b>JAR</b> file.
In particular <b>after</b> successfully building <b>JAR</b> file. Below you can find
complete sample <em>'build.xml</em> file for using unit tests generator during your
development.
</p>
<p>
To use it in your developing process you must define new task in your
<code>build.xml</code>. To do this put in the beggining of your build file such lines:
<pre>
    &lt;taskdef name="unitgen"
             classpath="some_dir/unittestsgen.jar"
             classname="testsgen.taskant.UnitTestsGen"/&gt;
</pre>
Where, of course, <code>'some_dir'</code> is directory where <code>'unittestsgen.jar'</code>
file exists.<br/>
Since we already defined new task we can use it at any time we need it. Of course
it can be used in many ways depends of particular case. I recomend very simple but
effective use. Look below to see almost complete very simple <code>build.xml</code>
sample.
<pre>
&lt;project name="UnitTestsGen" default="dist" basedir="."&gt;
    &lt;taskdef name="unitgen" classname="testsgen.taskant.UnitTestsGen"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="src" value="src"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="test-src" value="test-src"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="build" value="build"/&gt;

    &lt;target name="compile" description="Compile sources in ${tmpsrc} directory"&gt;
        &lt;mkdir dir="${build}"/&gt;
        &lt;javac srcdir="${src};${test-src}" destdir="${build}"
               debug="on" deprecation="off"&gt;
            &lt;classpath&gt;
                &lt;pathelement location="${libs}/junit.jar"/&gt;
            &lt;/classpath&gt;
        &lt;/javac&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;
    &lt;target name="jar" depends="compile"&gt;
        &lt;jar jarfile="jar/${jarfile}.jar" manifest="MANIFEST.MF" basedir="${build}"&gt;
            &lt;exclude name="** /*TestCase*.*"/&gt;
            &lt;exclude name="TestAll.*"/&gt;
        &lt;/jar&gt;
        &lt;unitgen update="true" classpath="${build};${libs}/junit.jar"
                 imput="${src}" output="${test-src}"/&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>
After excecuting command <code>'ant jar'</code> you should see similar output:
<pre>
compile:
    [javac] Compiling 36 source files to /home/kobit/projects/unittestsgen/build
jar:
      [jar] Building jar: /home/kobit/projects/unittestsgen/jar/unittestsgen.jar
  [unitgen] Finished work: files 21, sources 14, new classes 3, new methods 7

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
</pre>
Every time you will be building jar file all your source classes will be checked
against changes made and test classes will be updated if necessary.<br/>
In above sample <em>'unitteg'</em> task found 21 files in given directory and
14 files with source code which can be tested. So it generated 3 new test classes
and added 7 new methods to existing test classes.

1. Added code generation for wrapper classes for primitive
   types like Double, Float, Integer, and so on...
   It solved problem with compiling test classes which
   contained test code for get/set methods with wrapper
   classes as parameters.

2. For long type code generation added leading 'l' to
   values which solved problems with compiling test
   classes which contained code for get/set methods with
   long as parameter.

3. Added catching exceptions during get/set methods call
   for methods which require it. It solved problem with
   compiling test classes which called methods throwing
   exceptions.

4. Added catching exception during creating instance of
   tested class for constructors which throwing exceptions.

1. Support for choosing directory where test classes must be stored.
   You can use it with command line parameter and all created test
   classes will e saved in given directory.

2. Support for choosing test class naming convention. With command
   line parameter you can set pattern for names of test classes.
   You can decide that all test classes should have name of teh form:
   Test(...).java or (...)Test.java or (...)TestCase.java or something
   different.

   only for few hints for set/get methods. Some piece of code is 
   generated for simple tests and some comments are added in particular
   situations.

4. A lot of minor changes, improvments and bug fixes like corrected
   xml code for ant, some mistakes in docummentation, up to date
   README files and so on.

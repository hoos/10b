1. Major changes in design. That is reason for so strong change in
   version number. At the moment job parameters are _not_ pased to
   main processing methods as arguments. All parameters are stored
   in global property system and all parameters can be accessed by 
   all modules. It allow to very easy add new job parameters with out
   changing code of main module.

2. Added support for generating JUnit warnings in new created test methods.
   It can help developers to find test methods not covered by real test code.

3. Added support for ANT. From this version this tool can be used as ANT
   task and can be run every time during build process.

4. Added 'update' parameter. It allow unit tests generator to modify
   existing test classes if update is needed. Previous 'force' parameter
   was danger because it allow also overwriting existing test classes
   when compiled version was not found. It could cause to lost your
   existing test classes.
